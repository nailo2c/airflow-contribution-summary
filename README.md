# Apache Airflow Contribution Summary

## About
This repository serves as a portfolio summarizing my open-source contributions to the [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) project.  
My work focuses on improving system reliability, metrics observability, and provider functionality across Airflow‚Äôs core and ecosystem.

Through these contributions, I have deepened my understanding of large-scale workflow orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, and open-source collaboration.  
This experience continues to shape my approach to building scalable, data-driven infrastructure ‚Äî an area I aim to explore further through graduate study.

## üîç Additional Contributions
- Fixed outdated links across Airflow documentation (`18_contribution_workflow.rst`, `unit_tests.rst`).  
- Contributed to pre-release validation for Airflow 3.0 and multiple provider releases.  
- Reported and analyzed regression in `ti_successes` metric removal post-3.0 refactor.  
- Added `--batch-size` argument to `airflow db clean` for better resource control.  
- Enhanced Slack API operator reliability under rate-limit conditions.

## üí¨ Reflection
Contributing to Apache Airflow has strengthened my ability to work within large-scale, distributed open-source systems.  
Through debugging complex workflows, enhancing metrics observability, and coordinating with maintainers,  
I gained practical experience in **system design, data engineering, and collaborative development**.  

These contributions not only refined my technical depth but also cultivated my skills in mentoring, documentation, and long-term maintainability ‚Äî  
qualities I intend to continue developing through the **University of Washington Professional Master‚Äôs Program in Computer Science (PMP CS)**.
